## 🚀 About Me
👋 Hi there! I'm Ashshak, an enthusiastic undergraduate student at the University of Colombo in the Faculty of Technology. I'm passionate about delving into the exciting realms of Computer Vision 👁️ and Robotics 🤖. I thrive on connecting the dots and uncovering similarities between various concepts, leveraging this approach to fuel problem-solving. I'm constantly seeking ways to enhance my skills and refine my ability to tackle challenges effectively 🔍. Outside of academic pursuits, you'll likely find me expanding my professional network and knowledge on LinkedIn 📥. Thanks for stopping by my profile, and I'm eagerly looking forward to connecting with you!
